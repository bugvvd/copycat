## DOM Operation

`index.html`
Get a DOM node by its id
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  <!-- <script src="script.js"></script> --> <!-- null -->
  </head>
  <!-- <script src="script.js"></script> --> <!-- null -->
  <body>
    <!-- <script src="script.js"></script> --> <!-- null -->
    <div>hello react-mini</div>
    <div id="container">pold</div>
    <!-- <script src="script.js"></script> --> <!-- works -->
  </body>
  <script src="script.js"></script> <!-- works -->
</html>
```
Were the script be loaded before body is rendered, `container` would be null. Why?[Solve - Cannot read property 'value' of Null in JS](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/javascript-cannot-read-property-value-of-null#:~:text=To%20resolve%20the%20%22Cannot%20read,the%20getElementById%20method%20returns%20null%20.)

and `script.js`
```js
console.log("hello react-mini");
const container = document.getElementById("container");
console.log(container, container.innerHTML);
setTimeout(() => {
  container.textContent = "new";
  console.log(container, container.innerHTML);
}, timeout);

```
it can be observed that in 1 sec, `old` is changed into `new`

## Issue

1. `console.log()` synchronicity

If `script,js` is this way,
```js
const container = document.getElementById("container");
console.log(container, container.innerHTML);
container.innerHTML = "new";
console.log(container, container.innerHTML);
```

The 2 console logs in `script.js` print the same `container` with `innerHTML` as `new text`, but print different `container.innerHTML` with `old` and `new`

There are several lens to this problem,
1. `console.log()` is **asynchronous** (and not standard across platforms and time) with rendering. Therefore `console` will need to store the logged values somewhere, by referencing it or serializing it. 
2. `container.innerHTML()` is synchronous while the rendering will happen asynchronously.
3. 

best guess:
1. `console.log()`, with `container` object, referencing, with `container.innerHTML`, seralizing.
2. thus when `console.log()` is called, its first argument referencing to object `container` is changed to `container`'s latest state which is `<div id="container">new</div>` in this case, while its second argument serialized is unchanged.
